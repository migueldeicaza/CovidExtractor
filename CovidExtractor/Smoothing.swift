     Apply a seven-day simple moving average to the input data, and then apply exponential smoothing.
     
     The seven-day SMA is applied to knock out the typical day-of-week fluctuations of covid data.
     Reported data are typically higher/lower based on day of the week, and we want to remove that noise
     to improve graph readability.
     
     The exponential smoothing will smooth out the data a bit more by calculating
     the current exponential smoothing value as 30% of this element's value + 70% of yesterday's
     exponential smoothing value. 30% is a fairly high value for ES, and we're using a value that
     high because there's a tradeoff between how much smoothing you have and how much your data
     lags. We already have a lag since we're applying a 7-day SMA first, so we just want a light
     EMA application.
